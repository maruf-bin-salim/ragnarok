                        <br>
                        Some Creative Ideas: Add colorful vinegar and olive oil bottles along with salt and pepper
                        shakers and place it on a countertop or Lazy Susan. Add your favorite candle and some seasonal
                        foliage. Use it as a small plant stand. For Christmas, fill it with holly berries, evergreen and
                        miniature ornaments. In a coffee bar, add unique jars holding cream and sugar. Place it in a
                        bathroom with glass jars holding cotton balls and q-tips. The possibilities are endless.

                                The napkin holder is well constructed, nice corner seams and paint job. The dangle is
                                heavy which makes it feel like quality. Actually, I will use this for napkins but also
                                for other things. It is so cute and simplistic. I needed something to hold our vitamin
                                bottles on my kitchen counter so I remember to take them. Multipurpose love that! The
                                napkin holder came in a nice box with the company logo, which would be great if I was
                                giving it for a gift.

                                This cute white square wooden box could be used for napkins or any other table decor. I
                                will use it for napkins but could also be used to hold salt & pepper or other
                                condiments. Also, the latest artificial cactus would look nice in these boxes on a table
                                or shelf. Just need imagination!

                        Our charming paper towel trays will look delightful and bring a touch of elegance to your home.

                        <br>
                        When not needed for guests, replace the paper towels with a pretty soap dispenser and a nicely

                        candle
                        with seasonal elements. Bring an extra touch of elegance to a buffet with pretty, themed napkins

                                <br>
                                I bought this for Thanksgiving to store "The Fancy Towels for Guests Only!" and it's way
                                cuter than I expected...my HUSBAND even complimented it WITHOUT ME ASKING! And this is a
                                man who never notices when I get my hair done or come from a fresh visit to the
                                esthetician. So yeah, it's cute. After the holidays, I'll remove the towels and save
                                them for next time (I bought 200, they're also nice and fit perfectly) and put makeup
                                etc in it.

                                This holder is beautiful and elegant. In this day and age of Covid, many guests are not
                                comfortable using a hand towel. I had this out for the holidays and got many
                                compliments. They wanted to know where I bought it. I also purchased a good quality
                                paper guest towel. This beats a roll of paper towels in your bathroom.
